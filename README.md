# Face-Mask-Detection
The Face Mask Detection project aims to detect and classify whether individuals are wearing face masks or not. By utilizing computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project provides a solution to help enforce mask-wearing protocols in various settings.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Utilize webcam or video feed to perform real-time face mask detection. The system will identify faces and determine whether individuals are wearing masks accurately and quickly.

Accuracy and Reliability: Employ state-of-the-art deep learning models to ensure accurate and reliable face mask detection. The models are trained on diverse datasets and optimized for robust performance.

Alert System: Generate visual or audio alerts whenever face mask non-compliance is detected. The system can notify relevant authorities or personnel in real-time to take appropriate action.
